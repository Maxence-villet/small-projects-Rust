
Beneath a sky where galaxies unfurl,
A legend breathes, of lovers and a world
Where mountains carved their names in windswept stone,
And oceans sang of passions yet unknown.

He, son of storm and lightning's jagged spark,
With eyes that held the fury of the dark,
She, woven from the sunlit morning mist,
A whisper soft, on lips untouched by frost.

Their meeting, fate, a clash of thunderous pride,
Two titans met, on destiny's wild ride.
Her touch, a balm on chaos, fierce and raw,
His love, a shield against the moonlit maw

Of doubt and fear, that gnawed at mortal days,
They crossed the plains where ancient dragons grazed,
Scaled peaks of ice, where stardust kissed the sun,
Through battles fought, and victories won.

Their love, a beacon in the twilight's fall,
Two flames entwined, defying shadows tall.
For love, the bard would sing in ages bold,
A tale of hearts, in tapestry of gold.

A symphony of souls, on endless quest,
Through trials forged, to love's eternal crest.
Their names etched high, on heavens' starlit scroll,
The epic love, that conquered every soul.

So raise a glass, to heroes yet unseen,
Where whispered legends paint the moonlit scene.
For love's the fire that burns both fierce and bright,
An epic flame, that conquers day and night.
